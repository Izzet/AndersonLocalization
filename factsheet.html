            <h2>Wave propagation</h2>
            <p>
            Anderson Localization is intrinsically wave phenomena, so, lets start
            with common example - a stone thrown into the water. This causes a ripple
            to spread accross the water surface, travelling in all directions until it fades
            away. </p>
            <p>
            Now imagine a different surface, where several small rocks peek
            above the water level. When we throw our stone now in between these
            "impurities", wave is scattered
            off the rocks and creates more complex pattern. Also, it takes a longer time
            for some ripples to get further away from the point of stone impact.</p>
            <p>
            Anderson localization very generally describes similar phenomena. It predicts
            that certain amplitude in a medium only decays with time if the medium
            is not very chaotic - mainly consists of either flat or periodic structures. If the
            medium contains many impurities (pebbles), without friction, the amplitude
            of the wave at the place might not decay at all!</p>
            <p>
            Originally (in P. W. Anderson's article <i> Absence of diffusion in certain random lattices</i> 
            from 1958), the Anderson localization was derived from Schrödinger equation,
            thus applying mainly to quantum particles. However, the same physics can be applied
            to a general wave, and we can observe Anderson localization in many situations. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="waveEvolution">
            <h2>Wave diffusion</h2>
            <p>
            To better visualize Anderson localization, simple computer simulations of behaviour of 
            quantum particles - matter waves are presented below. The Schrödinger equation (equation ruling
            the motion in quantum mechanics) was used to model a particle spreading from the
            original position (marked by blue line) over time. The particle is represented here by
            a probability density, which, at every point, is proportional to the probability of observing
            the particle at said point. At the beginning, the particle is known to be at some starting position,
            so the probability density peaks highly at the starting point. After some time, particle 
            can be somewhere else as well - probability density is more spread. The width of this spread
            is what concerns us here. </p>

            The images at the top were taken before the images at the bottom. Furthemore, the
            potential energy of the particle in the region has different profiles, shown in the lower
            part of the picture. </p>
            <p>
            The probability density of the particle at the constant and periodic potential keeps spreading, while
            the particle at random potential does not spread nearly as much. In fact, if we looked
            at how the probability density will look in very long time, only the random potential
            will have noticible peaks, in the other two situations, the particle will spread out much more - 
            the particle wave undergoes diffusion.</p>
            <p>
            Here, the random potential is completly random, which makes it easy to observe the localization
            in early simulation time. But, the potential does not need to be completly random. If there are only
            small random variations in the potential, the wave still localizes in one dimension, only the localization
            length grows.</p>
            <p>
            For classical systems, we would have to start from a different wave equation, but it turns out
            that the Anderson localization works similarly for classical waves. And as some of the properties
            of localization, such as Anderson transition, have predictions that are irrespective of the specific
            system, the same computational predictions can be verified by observations of both classical and
            quantum systems, which has also been done. </p>

            <h2>Current status</h2>
            <p>
            Since its theoretical prediction, Anderson localization has been applied to several different
            problems. First, and perhaps the one that it was originally supposed to solve, was 
            explanation of conductivity, or, in fact, the lack thereof, of certain materials. If the atoms
            in the material are effectively in one line or one plane (system has only 1 or 2 dimensions),
            the localization occurs even for very small disorder - very small random fluctuations of
            potential energy due to impurities. If the atoms are in whole space (3 dimensions), than there
            is certain amount of randomness beyond which the electrons in the material never diffuse.
            When the disorder is crossing this amount, we talk about Anderson transition. Interestingly, 
            Anderson transition predicts an explicit form of dependence of maximum width of the wave (called
            localization length) on the amount of disorder in the system, which does not depend on the
            inner structure of the system - the phenomena is common for different types of waves.</p>
            <p>
            Then, one would expect to find some
            classical system where the transition occurs as well, and indeed the same observation has also
            been made for ultrasound in disorder lattice of small aluminum beads. </p>
            <p>
            The localization of sound can be then used in designing a sound insulation - 
            the waves cannot diffuse in a disordered insulation, and are effectively trapped in it
            until they dissappear due to dissipative effects. </p>
            <p>
            But even though more than fifty years have passed since the original article, there
            are still unsolved questions in the field. For example, what happens, when we take into account
            the interaction of electrons with themselves in the lattice? Or if we can measure localization
            of mechanical waves, could we perhaps measure localization of seismic waves? And what about
            very cold atoms - by de Broglie relation, they have quite a big wavelength, could we perhaps
            localize them? Active research is still going on as of creation of this factsheet and the field is still
            very much alive. </p>

            <h2>Further reading</h2>
            <p>
            And how exactly can one show that waves localize in such way? Unfortunately, rigid derivation
            of these results requires more advanced mathematics, such as Laplace transforms and solution
            of Schrödinger wave equation, so it is not given here. If the reader is interested in this type
            of derivation, the original Anderson's article is quite extensive in description of the mathematical
            method. Also, <a href="http://indico.ictp.it/event/a09171/session/5/contribution/3/material/0/0.pdf">this</a>
            site provides a handfull introduction and comparisson to classical particle diffusion
            (http://indico.ictp.it/event/a09171/session/5/contribution/3/material/0/0.pdf).</p>
